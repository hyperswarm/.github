# Moving to Holepunch

__[Holepunch GitHub Org](https://github.com/holepunchto)__

In 2021, the Hypercore Protocol team formed Holepunch in order to massively accelerate the realization of a true P2P internet.

Holepunch is a app development platform that makes it easy to build, ship, and update fully P2P desktop/mobile apps without using any servers. Check out [Keet Alpha](https://keet.io) to see Holepunch in action! It's 100% built on top of Hypercore, Hyperswarm, Hyperdrive, and the other modules you're seen if you're familiar with the Hypercore ecosystem. We're more committed than ever to maintaining and growing these modules in the long haul.

To tell a clear story and to ensure that our code is easily discoverable, we're consolidating modules that are currently scatted around different orgs. The modules that were previously in this org are now in the [Holepunch GitHub org](https://github.com/holepunchto).
